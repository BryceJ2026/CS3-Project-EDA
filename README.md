[All Terraria Weapons DPS V_1.4.4.9][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/acr1209/all-terraria-weapons-dps-v-1449/data]

## Column Desriptions

* Column 1: Name of Weapon
* Column 2: Class of Weapon
* Column 3: Game progress
* Column 4: Single target damage per second
* Column 5: Multi target damage per second
* Column 6: Single target damage per second with weapon and projectile
* Column 7: Damage per second multi target and weapons
* Column 8: Observations(Piece, and other things)

## Hypothesis/Question

1. Is there a correlation btwn this Dps and progress when it is obtained?
2. Does every weapon have multi target dps?
3. Is there any correlation to class and single target dps
4. Does the length of the name correlate to dps?
5. How many weapons does each class have?


## Visualisation plan

Come up with ideas for graphs to test your hypothesis
1. Dps vs game progress (probably a bar graph((x axis= Game progress, y axis dps)))
2. Pie chart for if all weapons have multi target dps
3. Circular bar plot for Class(x axis) and multi target dps(y axis)
4. ANOTHER BAR GRAPH for length of the names(string) aand the dps
5. Circular bar plot for distribution of class weapons.
